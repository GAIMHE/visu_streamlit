# Common Antipatterns

## Architecture
- God objects/components that own too many responsibilities.
- Tight coupling between unrelated modules.

## Code Smells
- Duplicated logic without shared abstractions.
- Silent exception swallowing.
- Implicit type coercion in critical logic.

## Operational Risks
- Missing observability around failures.
- No rollback or migration plan for risky changes.
