# Iteration Log - 2026-02-20 - 7-Month Research + Product Roadmap

## Context / Scope

Create a clear, actionable roadmap in markdown format for the next project phase, explicitly aligned with:
- 7-month calendar framing (M1 solo, M2-M7 with intern),
- already completed baseline work (data cleaning/preprocessing + exploratory Streamlit prototype),
- balanced dual objective (scientific publication + production visualization platform).

## Main Changes Made

1. Added new roadmap document:
- `ressources/roadmap_7m_research_product.md`

2. Structured content includes:
- locked key decisions,
- in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries,
- explicit workstreams and ownership split (you vs intern),
- month-by-month plan (M1 to M7),
- research question portfolio and selection criteria,
- analysis-to-visualization mapping requirements,
- production platform plan and UX principles,
- interface/contracts section,
- validation scenarios,
- end-of-roadmap deliverables and assumptions.

## Important Decisions and Rationale

1. Calendar framing is explicit:
- roadmap written as 7 total months to resolve ambiguity around intern start timing.

2. Balanced dual-track positioning:
- prevents over-optimizing for only publication or only product, and keeps outputs useful for both research and EvidenceB stakeholders.

3. Decision-complete structure:
- each month includes goals, tasks, deliverables, and gate to make execution handoff-ready.

## Follow-up Actions

1. Optionally align `ressources/roadmap_refined.md` with this new calendar roadmap through a short mapping section.
2. Build M1 execution artifacts:
- research question scoring matrix template,
- intern onboarding package skeleton,
- prioritized v1 product backlog.
