# Iteration Log - 2026-02-20 - Roadmap Concrete Tasking (6-Month Update)

## Context / Scope

Update the research-product roadmap to reflect clarified planning constraints:
- timeline changed to **1 month solo + 5 months with intern**,
- user requested much more concrete, non-jargon tasks,
- roadmap should be directly actionable month by month.

## Main Changes Made

1. Updated roadmap horizon and structure in:
- `ressources/roadmap_7m_research_product.md`

2. Major content changes:
- reframed roadmap to **6 months total**,
- added a concrete pre-intern checklist for month 1,
- rewrote monthly sections (M1-M6) with:
  - main objective,
  - explicit task list,
  - deliverables,
  - monthly gate,
- added a concrete analysis-to-visualization template table,
- added a simple month/team/output summary table.

3. Language style:
- kept plain language and operational phrasing,
- removed abstract wording where possible in favor of direct tasks and outputs.

## Important Decisions and Rationale

1. Keep existing file path:
- the roadmap stays in `ressources/roadmap_7m_research_product.md` for continuity,
- but content now clearly states 6-month execution reality.

2. Emphasize "prepare before intern arrives":
- dedicated checklist ensures M2 onboarding starts with no blockers.

3. Add "definition of done" behavior through monthly gates:
- each month now ends with a clear checkpoint (G0-G4).

## Follow-up Actions

1. Optionally rename roadmap file to match content:
- `ressources/roadmap_6m_research_product.md`
2. Create the three templates listed in M1:
- `research_question_scoring.md`
- `analysis_to_visualization_mapping.md`
- `monthly_progress_report.md`
3. Convert the M1 checklist into issue tickets before intern start.
