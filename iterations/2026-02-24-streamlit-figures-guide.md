# 2026-02-24 - Streamlit figures guide

## Context / scope
- Requested a simple Markdown report explaining each figure in the Streamlit app.
- Goal: clear, non-technical explanation of:
  - what each figure shows
  - what question each figure can answer

## Main changes made
- Added `ressources/STREAMLIT_FIGURES_GUIDE.md`.
- Covered all current figure blocks across pages:
  - overview page
  - usage/playlist/engagement page
  - objective-activity matrix page
  - ZPDES dependency page
  - classroom progression replay page
- Added a short “reading tips” section to help users combine figures in a practical workflow.

## Important decisions and rationale
- Used plain language and avoided heavy methodology wording.
- Kept the guide descriptive (decision support), without causal claims.
- Included both performance and progression interpretation angles to match teacher and product use cases.

## Follow-up actions
- Optional: add direct links from `README.md` to this guide.
- Optional: add one screenshot per figure block in a future visual companion file.
